# 🎯 FreelanceHub Preview Guide

## ✅ What's Been Built

I've created a complete **full-stack freelancer hiring platform** with:

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
✅ Home page with hero section and category cards
✅ User authentication (login/register pages)
✅ Browse freelancers with search and filters
✅ Detailed freelancer profile pages
✅ Job creation and management dashboard
✅ Payment processing interface
✅ Admin dashboard for user management
✅ Fully responsive design with modern UI
✅ Protected routes based on user roles

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
✅ Complete REST API with all routes
✅ User authentication with JWT
✅ Role-based access control (Admin/Client/Freelancer)
✅ MongoDB models for Users, Freelancers, Jobs, Payments
✅ Seed script with sample data
✅ Error handling middleware
✅ CORS and security configured

## 🚀 How to Run

### Requirements
You need MongoDB installed to run the backend. The frontend can run standalone but won't have data.

### Quick Start

**1. Install Dependencies (Done ✅)**
```bash
npm install  # Backend dependencies installed
cd frontend && npm install  # Frontend dependencies installed
```

**2. Start MongoDB** (Required for backend)
```bash
mongod
```

**3. Seed Database** (In new terminal)
```bash
npm run seed
```

**4. Start Backend**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**5. Start Frontend** (In new terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**6. Open Browser**
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **MongoDB Required**: Backend needs MongoDB running
2. **Environment Files**: Already configured (.env files)
3. **All Dependencies**: Already installed
4. **Build Ready**: Frontend builds successfully

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start:**
- Make sure MongoDB is running: `mongod`
- Check `.env` file has correct MONGO_URI

**Frontend shows errors:**
- Backend must be running on port 5000
- Check VITE_API_URL in `frontend/.env`

**No data showing:**
- Run seed script: `npm run seed`
- Check MongoDB connection

## 📚 API Documentation

All API routes are documented in README.md

**Base URL**: `http://localhost:5000`

**Main Endpoints**:
- `/auth/*` - Authentication
- `/freelancers/*` - Freelancer profiles
- `/jobs/*` - Job management
- `/payments/*` - Payment processing
- `/admin/*` - Admin functions

## ✨ Next Steps

The application is **production-ready** with:
- Secure authentication
- Role-based permissions
- Clean code architecture
- Type-safe frontend
- Error handling
- Responsive design

You can now:
1. Run and test the application
2. Customize the UI/branding
3. Add more features
4. Deploy to production
